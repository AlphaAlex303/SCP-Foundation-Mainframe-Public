<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-093</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Euclid</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> See testing document SCP-093-T1 for outline of testing conditions. SCP-093 must remain on a mirror at all times and under video surveillance. Admittance into the area of SCP-093's containment must be authorized only with proper video recording and subject retrieval procedures in place. Any attempt to use SCP-093 outside of an approved test will be dealt with severely, up to and including termination.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-093 is a primarily red disc carved from a stone composite resembling cinnabar, with circular engravings and unknown symbols carved at 0.5&#160;cm depth around the entire object. Deeper cuts are present on SCP-093 with a depth of 1 to 1.5&#160;cm. SCP-093 is 7.62&#160;cm in diameter and fits comfortably into most palms without abrasion. SCP-093 will change hue when held by a living individual. The colors taken by SCP-093 are still being researched to establish a link. Current belief holds that the changes depend upon regrets carried by the holder.</p>
<p>If SCP-093 is removed from a mirror and not held by a person, it will seek out the nearest mirror-like surface. SCP-093 has been observed to travel in the largest possible circle while rolling, building up phenomenal speed. The mechanism of this acceleration is currently unknown. If an obstacle is between SCP-093 and the nearest mirror-like surface, it will use this momentum to punch through the obstacle and continue on its course at this speed. It will only stop when a mirror-like surface is contacted. Despite tremendous impact velocities, no damage will be dealt to SCP-093 or the mirror.</p>
<p><strong>Additional Notes:</strong> No records exist to clarify the nature of SCP-093's discovery or presence in the Foundation. See SCP-093-OD. Since no records exist explaining SCP-093's method of containment, a test procedure was initiated to establish why mirrors must be used to contain it. The results of SCP-093-T1 lead to the discovery of living beings holding SCP-093 being able to move through mirrors and the series of tests in SCP-093-T2 to ascertain the destination reached through this travel.</p>

<p>When an instance of SCP-092 is inserted into the CD drive of a personal computer, its files can be accessed without triggering the anomalous effects. Examination of the files indicates that each CD has different content; all content is audio material by or pertaining to The 5th Dimension and its individual members: in addition to all known commercially-released songs, files contain live performances, practice sessions, auditions, media interviews, and personal conversations.</p>
<p><strong>Acquisition log</strong></p>
<p>On May 5th, ████, an unidentified man (henceforth SCP-092-B) carrying two suitcases approached front gate guards at Site-19, and stated that he wished to surrender himself and his anomalous creations into Foundation custody. The contents of his suitcases were confiscated, and classed as SCP-092; SCP-092-B was transferred to Site-37 for interrogation.</p>
<p>During interrogation, SCP-092-B revealed the thematic connections (five, dimensions, and The 5th Dimension) between all instances of SCP-092, and then committed suicide.</p>

<h5><span>Transcript of statement made by SCP-092-B upon arrival at Site-19</span></h5>
<p><strong>Guard</strong>: Sir, this is private property, you can't &#8212;</p>
<p><strong>SCP-092-B</strong>: This is a secret Foundation site, right?</p>
<p><strong>Guard</strong> &#8212; you can't come in here, sir, I &#8212;</p>
<p><strong>SCP-092-B</strong>: You're the SCP Foundation, and I'm a failure.</p>
<p><strong>Guard</strong>: &#8230; what was that, sir?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-092-B</strong>: You're the SCP Foundation, and I'm a failure. I think I'm clever, but I'm not. I'm a stupid boring nekulturny hack who thinks that money and cheap puns can take the place of talent and inspiration. I'm tasteless. I'm dull. I'm incompetent, I have no sense of style, and the only reason I'm not an art criminal is that nothing I've ever made is even close to being art. You can secure me, and you can contain me, but no one can protect me. Please take me and my anomalous garbage into custody.</p>
<p><em>(At this point, guards summoned backup. SCP-092-B repeated this statement verbatim until he was taken into custody.)</em></p>

<blockquote>
<h5><span>Excerpt from transcript of SCP-092-B interrogation session #2</span></h5>
<p><strong>Interviewer</strong>: Yes, we understand about &quot;five-ness&quot;, thank you, that's been most helpful, but we were also wondering what you could tell us about <em>how</em> you made these.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-092-B</strong>: I just wanted to be cool, you know? I really did. I thought&#8230; well, I had my inheritance, and my collection, and there was the estate, and the abandoned museum, and so much of the stuff went together, and it wasn't that tough, and&#8230; look, my ideas were better than yours! They were! I know they were! No! They're not! Nobody's impressed by stupid facile wordplay. It's not even <em>good</em> wordplay, it's kindergarten-level paronomasia, oh look FIVE DIMENSIONS WHAT OTHER THINGS CAN YOU THINK OF THAT COME IN FIVES, I'm worthless. I'm worthless.</p>
<p><strong>Interviewer</strong>: Better than <em>my</em> ideas?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-092-B</strong>: There's no deeper meaning to what I did, it's all just superficial Potemkin-village crap pumping imitation SHIT into the river of human achievement. It's Stein's fucking Oakland, and I don't even FUCKING understand those FUCKING allusions. I'm an uninspired wannabe, I'm boring, I'm a useless hack with NO FUCKING IMAGINATION. I've wasted and ruined miracles, I've squandered so much raw material that better people could have done so much with&#8230; I just&#8230; I'm not cool. I never will be. I'm really sorry about the mess. These aren't my arms.</p>
