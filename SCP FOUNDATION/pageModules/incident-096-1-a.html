<em>A large steel cube is shown in the middle of a research lab, which is teeming with a dozen or so researchers. In view of the camera is a control booth, displaying readings from the various sensors inside the cube.</em></p>
<p>[Fast-forward one minute, thirty-two seconds]</p>
<p><em>The control booth operator leans forward, alerted to the various readings on the sensors. Approximately five seconds later, a steel wall on the containment cube receives a sizable dent bending outward. The dent becomes larger before breaking. SCP-096 is seen bending the steel away, frantically trying to escape. Emergency plates drop on the cube as a containment breach is sounded.</em></p>
<p>[The security tape has SCP-096’s face blurred out as per containment protocol]</p>
<p><em>Two security teams enter the room as SCP-096 breaks out of containment. Live rounds and tranquilizer darts are fired to no visible effect. Approximately 90% of researchers and security personnel have directly viewed SCP-096’s face, and a Code Lima is declared. The room and surrounding areas are sealed and flushed with ██-class nerve agent.</em></p>
<p><em>Approximately two minutes later SCP-096 breaches Research Site ██ and travels ██ km/h through the outside desert, traveling ████.</em><br />

<p><em>“Echo Romeo was assigned to immediate containment breach. When we realized just how big a breach we were dealing with, we were completely overwhelmed. Funny, how even the best and brightest minds in the world can be so unprepared.”</em></p>
<p><em>“So you are saying it is your own fault?”</em></p>
<p><em>“Absolutely not. This was a new discovery in SCP-096’s behavior. We had no way to know, and we are lucky it did not turn into an XK.”</em></p>

<p><em>ER-A listens to the radio as orders (identified as coming from Dr. Dan) are relayed. SCP-096 can be seen slowly gaining speed.</em></p>
<p><em>ER-A motions off camera. ER-3 appears, holding a modified XM500 anti-materiel rifle. Two shots are fired; the first misses and the second hits SCP-096 in the lower leg. SCP-096 stumbles but recovers. Speed change is insignificant.</em></p>
<p>ER-A: -Unintelligible- …peat no effect on target!</p>
<p><em>ER-A motions to ER-3 again. ER-3 fires three more shots; the first two miss, and the third hits SCP-096 in the head. SCP-096 falls, skids, and rolls several times, reducing its speed minimally. SCP-096 rolls to its feet and continues unabated.</em></p>
<p><em>Camera pans up to see eight V-22 Ospreys (belonging to MTF Tau-1) flying overhead and past the helicopters on the same outbound vector as SCP-096. Camera cuts out.</em></p>

<p>[Dr. Oleksei appears very calm, determined, and answers all questions slowly and deliberately.]</p>
<p><strong>Interviewer:</strong> Where were you exactly at the time of breach?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Oleksei:</strong> On break, getting a cup of coffee. It was pure luck I wasn’t caught in the containment area.</p>
<p><strong>Interviewer:</strong> Describe your actions directly after the containment breach.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Oleksei:</strong> I sent Echo Romeo after SCP-096 and alerted Dr. Dan to the situation. We then set upon the task of locating SCP-096-1. Once the general direction of SCP-096 was determined, I sent Mobile Task Force Tau-1 ahead to evacuate civilian population centers in SCP-096’s path. All according to containment protocol.</p>

<p>[Dr. Daniel &quot;Dan&quot; ███████ sits patiently. On the table in front of him is what looks to be a set of modified night vision goggles.]</p>
<p><strong>Interviewer</strong>: For the record, where were you exactly during SCP-096’s containment breach?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Dan:</strong> In the [DATA EXPUNGED] Mountain Range, trying to find more information on SCP-096’s origins. It was a quick research expedition, so I left Dr. Oleksei in charge of containment. He is competent enough, if a bit… eager, and has proved himself in the past. This is all confirmed by the various related paperwork, so don’t go thinking-</p>
<p><strong>Interviewer:</strong> It was just for the record, doctor. Now, knowing that SCP-096 is immune to all known forms of damage while in an enraged state, why would you order the sniper attacks from the emergency response team?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Dan:</strong> Why not? If there was a chance to slow down SCP-096 and give MTF-Tau-1 more time, then we had to try it. It put ER in no danger and the choppers were in danger of being outrun anyway. Honestly, ER could do little else to help or harm the situation.</p>
<p><strong>Interviewer:</strong> I see. Now, could you explain this?</p>
<p>[Interviewer motions to the goggles lying on the table]</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Dan:</strong> Yes. This is Project SCRAMBLE, an eyepiece we assigned to ER and MTF-Tau-1, designed by Dr. Oleksei and myself specifically for SCP-096. It carries a small microprocessor which constantly analyzes the viewing field for the facial features of SCP-096. Facial recognition software inside instantly identifies them, scrambling the image into an unrecognizable mess before the light reaches the human eye. It’s quite ingenious, really.</p>
<p><strong>Interviewer:</strong> And expensive.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Dan:</strong> Very. Which is why it’s such a shame it didn’t work.</p>

<p><strong>MTF-T-1:</strong> What outbound vector is the target currently heading?</p>

Um, outbound vector is… [DATA EXPUNGED] degrees by [DATA EXPUNGED]. Next town on this vector is… [DATA EXPUNGED]. I’d say a couple hundred kilometers. Shit… MTF, we’re suggesting Echo Romeo begin evacuating the I-40. I don’t know how many cars the target has wrecked.</p>
<p><strong>MTF-T-1:</strong> Hold one. That’s a negative, Big Brother. ER is reporting that the target is outrunning her choppers. They can’t get ahead of him.</p>

<p><strong>Major Jack Wilford (Current commander of MTF Tau-1):</strong> I was looking through SCP-096-1’s house with my squad. Poor bastard was a semi-pro mountaineer, took a trip to the █████████. Apparently he took a snapshot of the landscape, and just happened to catch SCP-096 in the background.</p>
<p>[Wilford holds up four fingers for emphasis]</p>
<p><strong>Wilford:</strong> Four pixels. Four fucking pixels. I doubt the guy even knew what he saw. He was probably just lookin’ at the picture one day, noticed an off-color patch of snow, and went on with his day.</p>
<p><strong>Interviewer:</strong> How did you find it?</p>
<p><strong>Wilford:</strong> Our SCRAMBLE gear picked it up right away. The lieutenant got the picture and took it down to the chopper before I ever got to see it. By then the damn monster had taken down Big Brother and it had peeled open the [former] Major’s Stryker. All hell was breaking loose.</p>
<p><strong>Interviewer:</strong> So the SCRAMBLE gear was ineffective?</p>
<p><strong>Wilford:</strong> Ineffective? The goddamn SCRAMBLE were pieces of shit that killed the whole damn task force. You know only three people are alive besides me? All because some retard egghead thought of a “state-of-the-art countermeasure to SCP-096’s hostile reaction.” Those bloody idiots could have just put a bag over the target’s head and be done with it but no, we had to use state-of-the-fucking-art SCRAMBLE.</p>

<p><strong>Interviewer:</strong> Do we need to administer a sedative, doctor?</p>
<p>[Dr. Dan takes a breath and smooths his coat]</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Dan:</strong> No, no. I apologize. [Sighs] SCRAMBLE was really an ingenious idea. However, it was a failure because we did not fully know how SCP-096 worked. You see, as the chip inside SCRAMBLE picked up SCP-096’s facial features and began scrambling them, there was a split-second of uninterrupted light flow to the retina. Computers are fast, but not as fast as light. So, there was a split-second image of SCP-096’s direct face sent to the brain. It wasn’t even consciously received, but apparently it was enough to trigger the hostile reaction in SCP-096.</p>
<p><strong>Interviewer:</strong> So, with this report of the photograph…</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Dan:</strong> That’s the most disturbing part of this whole incident. You know when the former SCP-096-1 went on his mountain trip? 199█. That’s ██ years of that photo hanging there before he saw SCP-096. Since the brain doesn’t need to be aware that it is viewing SCP-096’s face to trigger the reaction, there can be ticking time bombs hidden literally anywhere in the world. How many photographs are out there containing SCP-096, just going unnoticed, waiting for a careful eye? As I said before, I want this thing terminated. Now.</p>
